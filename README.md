## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to extract image data from a specific website. We utilize web scraping techniques to automate the process of gathering images, allowing us to download them efficiently for various purposes such as datasets, analysis, or presentations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Selenium WebDriver
- BeautifulSoup (bs4)
- Requests

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-scraping-project.git
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this project:
- selenium
- beautifulsoup4
- requests

To install the necessary packages, you can use:
```bash
pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests
```

3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Update the `config.py` (or the relevant script) to specify the target website and any other parameters like the output directory for images.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python scrape_images.py
   ```

The script will open a browser session, navigate to the specified website, and begin downloading images to the designated folder.

## Features
- Automatically navigate websites and extract images.
- Customizable scraping parameters (e.g., target image size, file type).
- Supports multiple pages (pagination).
